# Business Central Samples - Warehouse Helper

The Warehouse Helper sample consists of an AL extension, a Power App, and a Power Automate flow. The app can scan a barcode and attempt to map the value to a Business Central item's GTIN property.

The AL Extension adds relevant APIs to Business Central and includes a sample data page called **Warehouse Helper sample data**. The sample page has an action that adds GTIN values to a set of items that match the [Sample barcodes](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/WarehouseHelper/blob/main/SampleBarCodes/Sample%20Barcodes.pdf).

## Try the sample yourself
Follow the steps in the [Try our sample apps](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go/blob/main/Scenarios/TryPowerPlatformSamples.md) guide to try the sample with your own tenant.

## Per Tenant Extension Project
This repository is based on the preview AL-Go for GitHub template, which is available [here](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/AL-Go-PTE).
